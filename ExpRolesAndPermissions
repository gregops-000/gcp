Export Roles and Permissions from GCP Cloud:


# Export roles and permissions from the source GCP project
gcloud projects get-iam-policy YOUR_SOURCE_PROJECT_ID \
  --flatten="bindings[].members" \
  --format="json" > iam_export.json

# Save the exported IAM policy to a text file
cat iam_export.json > exported_permissions.txt

Replace YOUR_SOURCE_PROJECT_ID with the actual ID of your source GCP project. The exported IAM policy will be saved in both JSON (iam_export.json) and text (exported_permissions.txt) formats.
