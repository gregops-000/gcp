# Import roles and permissions to the target GCP project
gcloud projects set-iam-policy YOUR_TARGET_PROJECT_ID iam_export.json

# Verify the imported IAM policy
gcloud projects get-iam-policy YOUR_TARGET_PROJECT_ID --flatten="bindings[].members" --format="json" > imported_permissions.json


Replace YOUR_TARGET_PROJECT_ID with the actual ID of your target GCP project.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to manage IAM policies in both the source and target GCP projects. Additionally, ensure that you have the gcloud command-line tool installed and authenticated.
