Export Roles and Permissions for a Specific Security Group:

# Export roles and permissions associated with SYSTEM_ADMINS@domain.com
gcloud projects get-iam-policy YOUR_SOURCE_PROJECT_ID \
  --flatten="bindings[].members" \
  --format="json" | jq 'select(.bindings[].members[] | contains("SYSTEM_ADMINS@domain.com"))' > iam_export.json

# Save the exported IAM policy to a text file
cat iam_export.json > exported_permissions.txt


# This script uses jq to filter the IAM policy to include only those entries that have members containing "SYSTEM_ADMINS@domain.com". Make sure to replace YOUR_SOURCE_PROJECT_ID with the actual ID of your source GCP project.
